Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for <%= name %>'s Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

<%= name %>'s Toy Order

<% if house_value > 1000000 %>
<% toys.each do |toy| -%>
<%if toy == 'Kaleidoscope' %>
<%    toy_price = 0 %>
<%   else%>
<%    toy_price = 1000%>
<% end%>
  <%= toy %> : $<%= toy_price %>
<% end -%>
<% elsif house_value >= 200000 && house_value <= 1000000 %>
<% toys.each do |toy| -%>
<%if toy == 'Kaleidoscope' %>
<%    toy_price = 0 %>
<%   else%>
<%    toy_price = 100%>
<% end%>
  <%= toy %> : $<%= toy_price %>
<% end -%>

<% end -%>

$<%= total_toy %>  Subtotal
$<%= total_toy * 0.13 %>  HST
====
$<%= total_toy * 1.13 %>  Total

Your total comes to $<%= total_toy * 1.13 %> Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of <%=name%>'s toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,
